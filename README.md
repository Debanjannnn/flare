# SimpleVoting Smart Contract

A beginner-friendly Solidity smart contract that enables a transparent and decentralized voting system.  
This project is ideal for learning fundamentals like state variables, mappings, structs, and simple access control.

---

## 📌 Project Description

**SimpleVoting** is a lightweight Ethereum-based voting contract where an owner creates candidates and controls when voting starts or stops.  
Once voting begins, each wallet address can cast **exactly one vote**, ensuring fairness and preventing manipulation.

This README is designed to be beginner-friendly and attractive for GitHub repositories.

## 🎯 What It Does

- Allows the contract owner to add candidates before voting starts  
- Enables starting and stopping the voting process  
- Lets users vote for a candidate by index  
- Prevents duplicate voting using `hasVoted` mapping  
- Provides public view functions to fetch candidate info and vote counts  

---

## ⭐ Features

- **Owner-only Permissions** – Only the deployer can manage candidates and control voting.
- **One Vote Per Address** – Ensured through a mapping to prevent double-voting.
- **Dynamic Candidate List** – Add as many candidates as needed.
- **Transparent Vote Counting** – Anyone can view candidate names and vote counts.
- **Beginner-friendly Codebase** – Clean, readable Solidity for learning and modifying.
